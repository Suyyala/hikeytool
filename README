This tool automates downloading and installing OS images for the HiKey board.
Please note that this is work in progress, you should review the scripts before
using them.

Usage:

1. Create a config file for the OS you wish to download/install
   -> refer to configs/template_* for details
   
2. Fetch the OS:
   # ./HiKeyTool.sh configs/<config.conf> fetch
   
3. Install the OS:
   # ./HiKeyTool.sh configs/<config.conf> flash

NOTE:
Currently, installing an OS to SD card is quite difficult due to the lack of
documentation regarding this specific part of the boot process. Support will
be added as soon as proper documentation is available.
